# relative search

This project demonstates complex programming topics including inheritance and polymorphism, multithreaded programming, networking, database programming, and web development. It is a custom search engine with a browser GUI that displays results only from sources in a close proximity to an input source.

### getting started
This project depends on multiple user libraries:
* Apache OpenNLP
* Apache Log4j2
* Apache Commons Lang3
* Apache Commons Text
* Eclipse Jetty
* MariaDB JDBC Driver
In order to launch the program, you will need to first setup these user libraries in your IDE.
Next, download the repository and import it to your IDE as a Java Project.
You may need to configure the build path to include the user libraries previously imported.
Launch the program on your local IP address by running the program in your IDE and opening a browser to localhost:8080

Before you can search for results, you will need to add an input link and allow the program to crawl links andd begin forming a relative 'web' of data. Follow the links below the search bar, add an input, and then navigate back to the home screen to begin searching in your own corner of the internet!
